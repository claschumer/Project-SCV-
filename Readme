The question we ask ourselves is :
Considering tennis games, is there a caracteristic shared by the winning players ? In other words, can one find patterns in the players and game informations ? For example, is the winner significantly taller than the loser ? Or is the number of breking point saved an important feature to win the game ? Or is there a corellation between the height of a player and the number of aces he perfomed ? 

To study that question, we will use a data set containg caracteristics of more than 2000 tennis games played in 2019 in master level tournaments. The datas can be found in our github project.
